# Zig 0.15.x Agent Skill

An [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io/) for the Zig programming language, targeting version 0.15.x.

## Why This Exists

LLMs struggle with Zig more than languages like TypeScript or Swift. The language is still evolving, there's less training data available, and models frequently use deprecated or removed syntax. This skill provides up-to-date context to guide models toward correct, idiomatic Zig code.

## What's Included

- **SKILL.md**: 357 lines covering critical patterns and common mistakes
- **references/**: 51 files totaling ~21,500 lines of documentation
  - Standard library module documentation
  - Idiomatic patterns (from [Zig Code Patterns](https://ziggit.dev/t/code-patterns/1748))
  - Build system guidance
  - Language reference content

## How It Was Made

Generated using Claude Opus 4.5 with the Zig standard library source code as context. Each module was documented by feeding the model the actual source files and using the [skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md) to structure the output.

The methodology prioritizes grounding the model in real source code rather than hallucinated documentation.

See https://austinrude.com/blog/making-a-zig-agent-skill/ for details.

## Usage

### Install as a Plugin

After the Claude Code is installed, you can install this skill as a plugin:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add zig-incubator/zig-skills
/plugin install zig-skills@zig-skills
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, install the `zig` directory into `~/.claude/skills/` per [Claude Code skill documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills).

Example prompt:
```
Using the zig skill please review @src/ and help me improve the codebase.
```

## Feedback

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/rudedogg/zig-skill/issues) if you find any hallucinations, inaccuracies, or outdated patterns. No need to write a detailed report with a fix—just knowing about the problem helps improve the skill.
